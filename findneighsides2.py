"""
This script loads a shape (3,nElems) array from a text file whose i-th row contains the index of the (possibly 1-indexed) nodes at each vertex of the i-th triangle 
of a non-ramified triangulation, and saves 3 text files containing each:
    - A shape (3,nElems) array whose i-th row contains, at position j, the index of the cell that neighbors cell i from side j.
    - A shape (3,nElems) array whose i-th row contains, at position j, the limiting side of the cell that neighbors cell i from side j.
    - A shape (3,nElems) array whose i-th row contains the index of the (now 0-indexed) nodes at each vertex of the i-th triangle.

Its implemented algorithm compares the three sides of each cell to the three sides of each other cell and positions neighbors and sides accordingly through precise
array manipulation, thus avoiding loops and conditional statements of any kind. This means that it can efficiently be parallelized or ran on GPUs through CUDA imp-
lementations of numpy such as cupy. This algorithm can be easily extended to arbitrary (even higher-dimensional) non-ramified tilings by translating "sides" into 
"faces" and all their concerning instructions.

It also has the option to load a text file containing the indices of cells to remove from the tiling, but I haven't tested what happens if one removes enough cells
to leave nodes isolated. I suspect that would be fine, but the resulting answers would assume the existence of said unused, isolated nodes.
